# recap 2

we looked at how these artists and designers are using code as their craft, ai as their medium and the web as their exhibition space and the world as their browser. programming can work sas a practiceas a creative medium to explore emergent systems, deconstruct digital interfaces, rethink the browser, create generative art. today, we're going to dive into the world of TouchDesigner.

- but before that, let's do a quick check-in on our homework.

# what is TouchDesigner? (touch)

***TouchDesigner is a visual development platform that equips you with the tools you need to create stunning real-time projects and rich user experiences. It's a node-based visual programming language that allows you to create interactive media systems, architectural projections, live music visuals, and more.***

translation: it's a tool that lets you make cool stuff that reacts to the world around it.

# why touch?

touch is a bit more visual than what we've done in p5js, and a bit more programmatic than processing. while it's nacent in the creative coding world, it was recently used to create the visuals for the 2024 olympics opening ceremony and the brand new openai presentation (somewhat overshadowed by k dot's shakespear-level performance).

# why touch? (cont.)

- the mental model is similar to other emerging tools which will be useful in the future.
- connecting nodes is similar to how we might "draw" a program on the whiteboard. 
- learn about the power of programming without getting bogged down in syntax.
- has built-in tools for working in "multimedia" (video, audio, 3d, etc.)
- it's free for non-commercial use (but with limited resolution).
- can be used for live performances, installations, and more.
- can be silly and serious at the same time.
- experimentalism
- fun
