# recap: Softness and Rhizomes

- Rhizomatic networks ≠ hierarchy

- Softness = yielding without giving up strength

- Fluid boundaries, emergent behaviors

- Prepares us mentally for entangled thinking

Softness taught us: you don't have to dominate something to collaborate with it.

# agency in sculpture
"Veiled Truth" by Antonio Corradini, 1753
It's marble, but look at how it behaves almost like fabric.

What's incredible is the sense that the veil—something that should hide—actually reveals more. It makes the figure seem alive, breathing under the stone.

It's a perfect example of how a material we think of as 'hard' can be made soft, intimate, and relational.
