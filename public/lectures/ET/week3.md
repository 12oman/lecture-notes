course: emerging & future design technologies  
---

# recap (prior weeks)

## week 1: future aesthetics
we explored how science fiction creates imaginative spaces for real technological innovations, establishing perceptual frameworks for possibility. key examples included:

* **gentle monster** stores as art
* **sophie's "faceshopping"** exploring digital identity
* **donna haraway's cyborg manifesto** as theoretical underpinning
* **breaking from corporate memphis** through alternative aesthetic systems
---

### week 1 questions
how do 
* commercial spaces, 
* media, 
* design 
challenge our understanding of identity and technological mediation?

---
## week 2: mapping the territory
we moved from maps to territories, examining:

* **enzo mari's work** - the relationship between technical drawings (maps) and physical artifacts
* **conway's game of life** as a simple rule system generating complex emergent behaviors

# today: dyson spheres & found logics in speculative futures

## key concepts

### found logics & scale
> "at what scale does newness occur? maybe our scale is currently shifting because we are moving from a society that produces for a market that has been (unfortunately) theorised to consist of consumers, to a society that produces for a market of creative producers."

---

* how sci-fi and gaming use **found logics** - taking existing systems and recontextualizing them
* why **scale shifts** matter when imagining crazy new tech futures

### the kardashev scale: framework for imagination
* **type I** (planetary) - using all the energy of a planet 
* **type II** (stellar) - using all the energy of a star
* **type III** (galactic) - using all the energy of a galaxy

---

### dyson spheres as speculative megastructures
* freeman dyson's wild idea (1960)
* theoretical structure that would wrap around a star to capture its energy
* shows how physics constraints can spark creative imagination
* pops up everywhere in sci-fi (star trek, games, books)

---

## class activities

### 1. scale exploration (20 min)
check out scaleofuniverse.com to explore relative scales from quantum to cosmic
* chat about: how does shifting perspective change how we see objects and systems?
* connects to bianca hester's work: "only from the perspective of an observer situated upon the surface of the earth does day and night occur"

---

### 2. found logic workshop (30 min)
* break into small groups
* grab everyday objects/systems (toasters, bikes, whatever)
* create speculative designs by:
  - putting them in weird contexts (space, underwater, inside the body)
  - scaling them way up or down
  - mashing their logic with other systems
* share your found logic with everyone

---

### 3. dyson sphere design challenge (40 min)
* groups design their own megastructure concept
* think about:
  - how to capture and distribute energy
  - where people would live
  - cultural vibes of such a structure
  - how it would look
* remember the principle: "wrap it up in tin foil, put it on a starry background, set it to a theremin sound"

## discussion questions

1. "how can we get from hand logics to claw logics?" - what does this question from the essay suggest about specialization vs generalization in tech development?

2. how do frameworks like the kardashev scale help us imagine stuff beyond our current tech horizon?

3. how might a "planetary society" be different from our current one in terms of design practices and aesthetic values?

4. what's the relationship between "art-school postmodernism" and technological innovation?

5. think about the quote: "we are always looking for counter-logics" - how can designers and technologists create truly new systems rather than just iterations of existing ones?

## homework

create a speculative design concept for a type II civilization artifact - something that would only be possible for a society that had harnessed the complete energy of its star. consider:

* what problem does it solve or what opportunity does it create?
* how does it function at the stellar scale?
* what aesthetic qualities would reflect its purpose and context?
* how might it change social/cultural relationships?

document your concept with sketches, diagrams, or whatever, and prepare a 5-min presentation for next week.

  - nasa concept art for space habitats
  - speculative engineering diagrams

"it doesn't matter if what you're experiencing is an original sign, a copy or simulacra if these possibilities—denatured signs, attenuated copies, metaphoric or metonymic permutations, experiments in semioticity, or just bad rip-offs—are deployed as part of the sanctioned script."

- from "Intergalactic, Planetary, Planetary, Intergalactic : 
Found Logics in Sci-Fi and Games" by Roman Mitch
