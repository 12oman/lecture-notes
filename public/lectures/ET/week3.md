course: emerging & future design technologies

### recap (1-2)
---
week 1: future aesthetics
we explored how science fiction creates imaginative spaces for real technological innovations, establishing perceptual frameworks for possibility. 

examples:
* **gentle monster** stores as art
* **sophie's "faceshopping"** exploring digital identity
* **donna haraway's cyborg manifesto** as theoretical underpinning
* **breaking from corporate memphis** through alternative aesthetic systems
how do 
* commercial spaces, 
* media, 
* design,
challenge our understanding of identity and technological mediation?

---
week 2: getting to the territory
we moved from imaginiative spaces to maps and territories, examining:

* **enzo mari's work** - the relationship between his technical drawings (maps) and his physical artifacts
* **conway's game of life** as a simple rule system generating complex emergent behaviors

---
# takeaways
* anything can work as a map of anything else. 
* the territory is the space of interaction between rules that you decide upon 
* and worlded outcomes. 

---
cheat code
in what ways are you always carrying a map?
* your phone
* your body
* culture
* mind

### today: intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic

* key concepts
* found logics 
* scale
when we talk about how anything can be a map of something else, 
we are invoking a design principle of found logics and the condition of postmodernism.

this might make you quesion: can anything can be new?

---

> "at what scale does newness occur? maybe our scale is currently shifting because we are moving from a society that produces for a market [...] of consumers, to a society that produces for a market of creative producers."

---

* how sci-fi and gaming use found logics 
* taking existing systems and recontextualizing them
* why **scale shifts** matter when imagining new tech futures

### the kardashev scale: framework for imagination
* **type I** (planetary) - using all the energy of a planet 
* **type II** (stellar) - using all the energy of a star
* **type III** (galactic) - using all the energy of a galaxy

---

### dyson spheres as speculative megastructures
* freeman dyson's wild idea (1960)
* theoretical structure that would wrap around a star to capture its energy
* shows how physics constraints can spark creative imagination
* pops up everywhere in sci-fi (star trek, games, books)

### activities

---

### 1. pre-class reading (15 mins)
read "Intergalactic, Planetary, Planetary, Intergalactic : Found Logics in Sci-Fi and Games" by Roman Mitch

---
### 2. watch (Beastie Boys Intergalactic) (4:34s)

[intergalactic](https://youtu.be/qORYO0atB6g?si=PR0Cmz8PDdUT7uwc)

---
### 4. discussion (15min)
examples
* how is scale used to open up newness?
* what kind of 'postmodernism' is at play?
---

### 3. visit the Intergalatic track on WhoSampled (10 min)
explore the 'intertextuality' of the song - how it samples and remixes other tracks

# how does this change your understanding of the song?

Notice how Intergalactic itself has been re-used in other peoples music (77 exapmmles)

this characteristic is a key part of postmodernism. 
music is a map of other music. 
design is a map of other design.

---
### 5. scale exploration (20 min)
check out scaleofuniverse.com to explore relative scales from quantum to cosmic
* chat about: how does shifting perspective change how we see objects and systems?
* connects to bianca hester's work: "only from the perspective of an observer situated upon the surface of the earth does day and night occur"

---
### 6. found logic workshop (30 min)
* break into small groups
* grab everyday objects/systems (toasters, bikes, whatever)
* create speculative designs by:
  - putting them in weird contexts (space, underwater, out of place)
  - scaling them way up or down
  - mashing their logic with other systems
* share your found logic with everyone

---
### 7. dyson sphere design challenge (40 min)
* groups design their own megastructure concept
* think about:
  - how to capture and distribute energy
  - where people would live
  - cultural vibes of such a structure
  - how it would look
* remember the sci-fi principle: "wrap it up in tin foil, put it on a starry background, set it to a theremin sound"

## discussion questions

1. "how can we get from hand logics to claw logics?" - what does this question from the essay suggest about specialization vs generalization?
2. how do frameworks like the kardashev scale help us imagine beyond our current horizon?
3. how might a "planetary society" be different from our current one in terms of design practices and aesthetic values?
4. what's the relationship between "art-school postmodernism" and technological innovation?
5. think about the quote: "we are always looking for counter-logics" - how can designers and technologists create truly new systems rather than just iterations of existing ones?

"it doesn't matter if what you're experiencing is an original sign, a copy or simulacra if these possibilities—denatured signs, attenuated copies, metaphoric or metonymic permutations, experiments in semioticity, or just bad rip-offs—are deployed as part of the sanctioned script."

- from "Intergalactic, Planetary, Planetary, Intergalactic : 
Found Logics in Sci-Fi and Games" by Roman Mitch

## homework (for week 4)

create a speculative design concept for a type II civilization artifact - something that would only be possible for a society that had harnessed the complete energy of its star. consider:
* what problem does it solve or what opportunity does it create?
* how does it function at the stellar scale?
* what aesthetic qualities would reflect its purpose and context?
* how might it change social/cultural relationships?

document your concept with sketches, diagrams, or whatever, and prepare a 5-min presentation for next week.
