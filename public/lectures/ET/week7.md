# why virgil abloh?

> "I'm interested in the space between these two disciplines... The in-between state is what I'm most attracted to." —Virgil Abloh

- Bridge between past and future
- Deconstructs and recontextualizes design history
- Creates new languages from existing vocabularies
- Embodies interdisciplinary approach

# introduction to deleuze

Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995)
French philosopher whose concepts provide useful frameworks for understanding design evolution

![deleuze teaching](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/35631029/original_2b9cbfb74c78560f86a4ccc63c67fd29.jpg?1743369829?bc=0)

# key deleuzean concepts

## rhizomatic thinking
- Non-hierarchical, multi-directional connections
- Any point can connect to any other point
- No clear beginning or end
- the internet art organisation rhizome.org takes its name from this concept

![rhizome](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/35631080/original_2c5f64dadd8324999637a0a9bd8c7097.gif?1743370080?bc=0)

# key deleuzean concepts

## deterritorialization
- Taking elements out of their original context
- Freeing objects from their established functions
- Creating new possibilities through displacement

![L.H.O.O.Q. by Marcel Duchamp](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/35631353/original_a62e754ddb034340f247441f96beba5c.png?1743370733?bc=0)

---
# key deleuzean concepts

## becoming
- The constant state of transformation
- Process rather than fixed state
- Design as ongoing movement rather than end product

# virgil abloh's design philosophy

## "the 3% approach"
- Change an existing design by only 3% 
- Find the minimal intervention needed to create new meaning
- Question: "How much can we twist the normal?"


---
# virgil abloh's design language

## quotation marks
- Creates distance from assumed meaning
- Questions authenticity and originality
- Turns objects into concepts


---
# abloh's micro-graphic system

- Industrial-inspired labeling
- Technical specifications as branding elements
- Lot numbers, manufacturing codes, and coordinates
- Creating authentic inauthenticity
- Typography as both functional and decorative element

---
# the ten nike collection

"REVEALING" vs "GHOSTING"


---
# "revealing"

> "uncovers the emotional details of each icon, offering a deconstructed, assembly-line feel that examines their past, present, and future."

- Deconstruction as revelation
- X-ACTO blade as primary design tool
- Making the invisible visible

---

![IMAGE: "REVEALING" text](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/35630943/original_68f799295b5118808ce60a6f18a802b8.png?1743369515?bc=0)

---
# "ghosting"

> "uses a transparent outer layer to create a seamless effect, blurring the lines that make us think we know a shoe, stripping away elements to find a baseline."

- Ethereal material palette
- Uncensored look at construction
- Challenging original expression
- also note the use of micro-graphics in the design

---

# connecting to deleuze

## the ten as deterritorialization
- Removing design elements from their context
- Exposing hidden structures and connections
- Creating new meaning through deconstruction

---
# connecting to deleuze

## the design process as rhizomatic
- Non-linear development
- Multiple entry and exit points
- Connections across time and function

how does this apply to my case studies?

# history of micro-graphics

- Modernist origins: Information design pioneers (Otto Neurath, Isotype)
- Technical documentation aesthetics (vector graphics, how-to guides)
- Japanese product labeling and packaging (Kawaii culture)
- Military and industrial markings (scopes, schematics)
- consider it as an evolution from purely functional to aesthetic element
- postmodernism brings playfulness and irony, texture and funciton to the modernist utopia
- Contemporary micro-graphics: digital, generative, and interactive 
- can be par tof a regenerative design process


---
# micro-graphics: form & function

- Creating information hierarchies
- Establishing visual systems
- Technical information as aesthetic object
- Navigational tools within complex spaces
- HUDs and interfaces
- Data visualization as branded experience
- Global legibility across language barriers


---
# micro-graphics as design language

- Typography as visual identity
- Technical specifications as aesthetic elements
- "quite information" doesn't compete with the primary message
- Codes and signs markings as narrative devices
- Informational density in minimal space
- Creating systems through typographic detail
- the indexicality of the micro-graphic



---
# case study examples: historic

1. Dieter Rams' 10 Principles of Good Design
     - Functionalism as design philosophy
     - Influence on contemporary minimalism, brutalism and by extension, micro-graphics

2. Memphis Group's Postmodernism
     - Reaction against modernist dogma
     - Pattern and color as rebellion


---
# case study examples: emerging

1. Generative Design
     - AI as design collaborator
     - Parametric possibilities

2. Micro-Information Systems
     - AR/VR wayfinding
     - Embedded information design
     - Dynamic micro-typography

[IMAGE: Visual examples of each]

# contemporary micro-graphics

## Examples from your research materials:
- Nocturnal design systems (flyers/posters)
- Certification and validation graphics
- Nissan technical specifications
- LAW bottle labeling systems
- Café Gismo receipt information design

[IMAGE: Examples from the provided research images]

---
# workshop: finding your case studies

## Consider these questions:
- What design movements challenged conventions?
- Where do you see historical influence in contemporary design?
- What emerging technologies interest you most?
- How might you visualize connections between past and future?


---
# mindmapping technique

- Start with your central theme
- Branch out to historic and emerging examples
- Look for unexpected connections
- Use visual language to show relationships



---
# applying deleuzean concepts

## For your assignment:
1. Identify design elements that have been deterritorialized
2. Map rhizomatic connections between your case studies
3. Show design as a process of becoming rather than fixed objects
