# Today's Agenda

1. Why this lecture? A course correction.
2. What speculative design actually *is* (and isn’t)
3. Dunne & Raby → Design as critique
4. Designed realities: worldbuilding as method
5. The spectrum: probable → plausible → possible → preferable
6. What makes an idea *an agent of change*?
7. Quick exercise: Break the cliché
8. Questions and expectations

# Why This Lecture?

> Too many of your current projects feel like *ads for a future product*, not *agents of change*.

- Predicting a trend ≠ Speculating a world
- Trend decks ≠ Conceptual design artifacts
- We need imagination that’s disruptive, critical, and transformative

# What Speculative Design *Isn’t*

- It's **not UX with a sci-fi skin**  
- It's **not just cool renderings of gadgets**
- It's **not a marketing pitch for future clients**

---
# What It *Is*

> “Speculative design is a tool for imagining alternative presents and futures that challenge the status quo.” — Dunne & Raby

- A thought experiment **in the form of design**
- A way to ask: **what if... ?**
- Not to predict, but to provoke

# Designed Realities

> “Design doesn’t just reflect reality — it helps create it.”

- Every design embeds assumptions about **values, behaviour, systems**
- You are designing **a worldview**, not just an object
- The “artifact” is a **proxy** for the world it belongs to

# The Futures Cone

- **Probable**: where we’re headed
- **Plausible**: could happen, based on current knowledge
- **Possible**: stretches beyond current trends
- **Preferable**: what we *want* to happen

Your work should lean **into the tension** between these.

---
# Agents of Change

Ask yourself:
- What norm does this challenge?
- What future does this resist or repair?
- What system would have to shift for this to exist?
- Who benefits? Who resists?

If it doesn’t shift something — it’s decoration, not speculation.

# The Cliché Trap

Too many student projects rely on:
- AI does it all
- Screens in weird places
- Floating UIs
- “It’s like Uber but for…”
- Digital tattoos, always

We need new metaphors. New critiques. **New logics**.

---
# Quick Exercise: Cliché Reversal

Think of one lazy trope you've seen or used (e.g., brain chip = smarter human).  
Now flip it:
- What if the brain chip **makes us dumber**?
- What if future tech is *boring*, *organic*, or *haunted*?

**Don’t design the gadget. Design the system it ruins or replaces.**

---
# Your Assignment

You're not designing *a* future.
You're designing **a reality where something crucial has shifted**.

Ask:
- What values structure this world?
- How is communication redefined?
- How does design shape the emotional, political, or cultural landscape?

The artifact is *a portal*, not the point.

---
# Questions + Expectations

I will mark harshly if:
- Your idea is uncritical, derivative, or safe
- You don’t engage with real systems of power or culture
- Your "future" is already here (but badly designed)

You’re being asked to **think harder**, **feel deeper**, and **design braver**.
