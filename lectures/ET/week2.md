# recap

last week, we discussed the role of science fiction in shaping our technological imagination. we looked at how speculative narratives can create the space for new inventions and perceptual frameworks. today, we're going to dive into the territory of the future.

#  the territory

if we look at enzo mari's work there is a drawing and there is the artifact. in this example the question for us is how is the drawing the map? can we see that he has created his own technical map for producing the artifact? ![enzo drawing](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/34758547/original_ad1a8e47615afd399c3bb6f6214acc1c.png?1740360596?bc=0)

#  the territory

the game of life by john conway is a great example of a territory. the rules are simple, but the outcomes are complex. the game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. one interacts with the game by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. ![game of life](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Gospers_glider_gun.gif)

## The Rules (Conway's Original)

* Birth: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
* Survival: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive
* Death: A live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies (loneliness)
* Death: A live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies (overcrowding)
