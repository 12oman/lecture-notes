# Recap: Deleuze and Rhizomatic Thinking

- Non-hierarchical connections
- Multiple entry and exit points
- Absence of fixed center
- Connections across seemingly separate domains

"Ginger as rhizome: The indigenous understanding of interconnected growth"

# Technology as Cultural Mirror

> "Throughout history, our understandings of technology have acted as a blueprint for conceptualizing the human and the living."

- 1747: La Mettrie's "Man a Machine" after steam power
- 1972: Liberman's "Cell as Molecular Computer" during cybernetic age
- 2025: Are we experiencing a "soft turn"?

# What is Softness?

> "Softness tends to be an experience more than an inherent property of things, one that emerges from an encounter between two bodies."

Key characteristics:
- Combination of fluidity and plasticity
- Yields to the world while learning from it
- Emerges from interaction, not isolation
- Exists on a spectrum, not as binary state

# Fluid + Plastic = Soft

## Fluidity
- Materials changing structure through time and space
- Continuously deconstructing and reconstructing boundaries

## Plasticity 
- Materials retaining information from the world
- Preserving the shape into which they were molded

# The Missing Majority

> "Soft, organic, perishable artifacts that were fundamental to the culture of prehistoric human groups but have been largely destroyed or forgotten."

- Western focus on stone, metals, and hard materials
- Textiles as revolutionary but overlooked technology
- Architecture's origins in fabric, not stone
- Clay's role in developing writing systems

# Cultural Bias Against Softness

> "Western culture's relationship to softness has been an ambivalent one. We have learned to reject softness as a mark of weakness and to celebrate hardness as a sign of strength."

- Gendered dimensions of material hierarchies
- Control vs. unpredictability
- Fixed vs. fluid boundaries
- Colonial perspectives on technology

# Te Ao Māori: Alternative Material Relations

- Traditional understanding of material softness
- Weaving as technological knowledge system
- Fluid boundaries between technology and culture
- Non-extractive relationship with materials

# From Hard to Soft Technologies

Hard Technologies:
- Mechanical assemblies of components
- Fixed boundaries and functions
- Resource extraction and environmental control
- Humans as engineers and controllers

Soft Technologies:
- Integration with biological processes
- Adaptive and responsive boundaries
- Symbiotic relationships with environment
- Humans as caretakers and cultivators

# Emerging Soft Technologies: Soft Robotics

> "Soft robots are crafted from flexible and deformable materials and don't require joints, actuators, or other electromechanical components"

- Octobot: first fully soft robot printed from silicone
- Movement through chemical reactions, not electricity
- Invertebrate organisms as inspiration
- Beyond anthropomorphic design

![IMAGE: Examples of soft robotics](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/35806416/original_dc084af9a0977ec6fb6c5cf6c37cd0fe.png?1743994392?bc=0)

# Emerging Soft Technologies: Biohybrid Systems

> "SymBots manifest a speculative future when synthetic and living materials will have co-evolved into a diversity of hybrid organisms."

- Living tissue integrated with synthetic materials
- Heart muscle cells providing autonomous energy
- Xenobots: microscopic synthetic organisms from frog cells
- Self-organization and self-replication


---
# Emerging Soft Technologies: Wetware Computing

> "An emergent technology in which living neurons, instead of silicon chips, are used as computing substrates."

- Neural networks as literal biological systems
- "Nano-intentionality" as foundation for intelligence
- Energy efficiency and adaptability
- Beyond algorithmic computation

# Softness in Design Applications

- Self-healing materials
- Responsive textile interfaces
- Biodesign and living materials
- Environmental sensing and adaptation
- Symbiotic architectural systems

[IMAGE: Examples of soft design applications]

# Implications for Design Futures

> "Fluidity and plasticity are becoming increasingly important concepts in scientific and social discourse about human identity."

- Rethinking agency and control in design
- Multi-scale complexity and emergent systems
- Distributed vs. centralized design approaches
- Sustainability through softness

# Workshop: Finding Soft Case Studies

## Consider these questions:
- What "soft" technologies have shaped design history?
- Where do you see softness emerging in contemporary design?
- How might soft technologies transform your field?
- What overlooked soft systems deserve attention?

# From Hard to Soft Case Studies

Historic examples:
- Textile technology evolution
- Indigenous material knowledge systems
- Flexible/adaptive architectural systems
- Biological design inspirations

Emerging examples:
- Self-healing materials
- Biofabrication and living design
- Responsive environments
- Symbiotic technological systems

# Assignment Connection

Remember research requirements:
- 2 historic + 2 emerging case studies
- Visual mind maps showing interconnections
- Analysis of technology's impact on design
- Consider softness as a lens for your research
- Look for overlooked or undervalued technologies
