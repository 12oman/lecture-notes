# breaking from corporate memphis

why are we watching sci-fi? science fiction has often been the first mover in creating the imaginary space for real inventions - think iPad in Star Trek. beyond prediction, it generates perceptual frameworks for technological possibility.

# today's reference points

* Gentle Monster stores as experimental laboratories
* SOPHIE's "faceshopping" - materiality and digital identity
* Constant Nieuwenhuys' new babylon
* Annihilation (2018) - bio-horror meets beauty

# Gentle Monster

retail spaces transformed into dynamic art installations that challenge traditional consumption models. each store becomes a narrative environment, blurring commerce and performance.

### warning: flickering light and rapid cuts

a critical exploration of digital identity, technological mutation, and the plasticity of self. connects to posthuman theories of identity and technological mediation.

# key themes

* retail spaces as art installations
* mutation as an aesthetic principle
* architecture as platform for play
* merging familiar and strange
* technology as a transformative force
* breaking boundaries between categories

### theoretical connections
* Donna Haraway's cyborg manifesto
* posthuman identity theories
* technological mediation of perception

---

# student discussion

* how do commercial spaces become experimental?
* where do you see signs of future aesthetics today?
* what current technology feels like science fiction?
* how might design challenge our understanding of identity?

note: these questions emerged from our class discussion last year, pushing the boundaries of traditional design thinking.

# next week

**futures archaeology mini assignment**

bring in an example of design that feels like it's from the future. this could be:
* a tiktok filter that reimagines human form
* a video game environment challenging spatial perception
* a product design breaking traditional categorizations
* an instagram account practicing radical visual transformation

**evaluation criteria**:
* pushes conventional aesthetic boundaries
* demonstrates understanding of emerging design principles
* shows critical engagement with technological mediation

look for things that push boundaries in unexpected ways. we're not just observing the future - we're excavating its earliest signals.
